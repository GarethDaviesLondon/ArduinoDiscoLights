# ArduinoDiscoLights

This is the code that ran the Arduino Disco Lights for AfrikaBurn 2019.
This is a DOTSTAR library (re-written to be faster) and some ananlogue signal processing.

Uses three analogue inputs which are filtered for sound level
There is a rotary shaft encoder for mode and also enables the change of length of DOTSTAR strip and access to calibrate functions.
